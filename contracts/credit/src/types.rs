//! Core data types for the Creditra contract.
//!
//! # What
//!
//! ABI-stable types that cross the contract boundary:
//!
//! - [`ContractError`] — 54-variant `#[repr(u32)]` error enum (discriminants
//!   pinned by `tests/error_discriminants.rs`). Each variant maps to a stable
//!   [`ContractErrorCategory`] via [`ContractError::category`]. See
//!   [`docs/contract-errors.md`](../../../docs/contract-errors.md) for the
//!   flat code table and
//!   [`docs/error-taxonomy.md`](../../../docs/error-taxonomy.md) for the
//!   categorized reference with recovery hints.
//! - [`CreditStatus`] — 5-variant state-machine label (Active=0,
//!   Suspended=1, Defaulted=2, Closed=3, Restricted=4). See
//!   [`docs/state-machine.md`](../../../docs/state-machine.md) for the
//!   transition graph.
//! - [`CreditLineData`] — the per-borrower record (limit, utilized, rate,
//!   score, status, accrual + suspension timestamps, accrued interest).
//! - [`RepaymentSchedule`] — installment metadata
//!   (`amount_per_period`, `period_seconds`, `next_due_ts`).
//! - [`RateChangeConfig`] — magnitude + cadence cap on
//!   `update_risk_parameters`.
//! - [`RateFormulaConfig`] — piecewise-linear rate formula parameters
//!   `(base_rate_bps, slope_bps_per_score, min_rate_bps, max_rate_bps)`.
//! - [`GracePeriodConfig`] / [`GraceWaiverMode`] — suspension grace policy
//!   (FullWaiver vs ReducedRate) consumed by [`crate::accrual`].
//! - [`OracleConfig`] — price-feed circuit-breaker parameters
//!   `(max_deviation_bps, max_age_seconds)`.
//! - [`ProtocolConfig`] / [`ProtocolSummary`] — host-side projections used by
//!   aggregate protocol queries (NOT `#[contracttype]`).
//!
//! # How
//!
//! All types are `#[contracttype]`-tagged unless explicitly marked
//! otherwise; this makes them cross the Soroban host ABI as structured
//! values. Discriminants on the two enums are ABI-stable; new variants must
//! be appended to preserve indexer and SDK compatibility.
//!
//! # Why
//!
//! These types are the protocol's externalized vocabulary. They are
//! consumed by off-chain indexers (`docs/indexer-integration.md`), by
//! SDK clients building transactions, and by integrators reading the
//! contract state for risk dashboards. Stability of the discriminants and
//! field layout is enforced by CI tests so a downstream consumer can pin
//! against a `major.minor.patch` of `CONTRACT_API_VERSION` (currently
//! `(1, 0, 0)`).
